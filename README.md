# github3.py

Eventually this will be a python module to access the GitHub v3 API.

## Easy Cloning

Assuming you have git 1.7.x (although I'm not entirely certain what version
it was introduced in) you can perform `git clone --recursive
git://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py.git github3.py` to clone this and
the submodule at the same time. Otherwise you have to do:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/sigmavirus24/github3.py.git
$ cd github3.py
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

# License

Undecided. I use GPL for a lot of things, but this is likely not going to be
GPL'd. Probably BSD or MIT since this would allow a lot more people to use it
with greater freedom. I'll likely open an issue to discuss this with myself. (No
one else is contributing to/watching this project yet, so why would I discuss it
with them.)
