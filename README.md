# github3.py

Eventually this will be a python module to access the GitHub v3 API.

# Dependencies

  * [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)

# License

Undecided. I use GPL for a lot of things, but this is likely not going to be
GPL'd. Probably BSD or MIT since this would allow a lot more people to use it
with greater freedom. I'll likely open an issue to discuss this with myself. (No
one else is contributing to/watching this project yet, so why would I discuss it
with them.)
