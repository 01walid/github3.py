HIGH PRIORITY
-------------

everywhere
----------

- Open a branch to experiment with slumber_ instead of requests. (It will 
  still rely on requests, but slumber just looks so much cleaner that what I 
  have now)
- Use requests ``params`` parameter to send parameters from the URl

  - Alternative: furl_

github3.api
-----------

- Add anonymous functionality for more areas of the API

unittests
---------

- We need to test everything right now. **EVERYTHING**

Plan
====

- Write unittests for everything possible, try to find as many corner cases as 
  possible
